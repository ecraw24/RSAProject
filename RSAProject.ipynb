    "The following sections and corresponding code represent a method for encrypting and decrypting data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is RSA?\n",
    "RSA encryption is a public key method that allows the theoretical receiver to send a public key to the theoretical sender. The sender encrypts their message with the public key and sends the encrypted message. The receiver decrypts the message with their private key to receive the message. Imagine Joe, a person who wants to receive a message from Susan. Joe sends a box and an unlocked padlock to Susan who puts her message in the box and locks the padlock. Joe is the only one with the key to the padlock; so, even if someone steals the box from Susan, they cannot unlock the box without Joe's key. In addition, someone could steal the open box with the unlocked padlock and add their own message, but they still would not be able to unlock the lock. The box and unlocked padlock represent Joe's public key that is sent to Susan, but could be safely intercepted and stolen without any risk to Joe. The key to the padlock represents Joe's private key which is never sent, exchanged, or otherwise put in harm's way, unless Joe chooses to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does it work?\n",
    "The privacy and virtual safety of Joe's private key relies on the difficulty of factoring primes. With a sufficiently large key, it could take years for the fastest computer to factor out the primes of that number. However, we can easily create a large key with a random selection of primes in a few seconds. Quantum computing may significantly decrease the amount of time it takes to factor out primes, which may compromise the security of any system that uses RSA encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does the project show?\n",
    "The project starts with a basic toolset for converting numbers to characters. The second toolset contains functions that represent the math behind RSA encryption. This includes:\n",
    "1. Fast Modular Exponentiation Algorithm: calculating problems of the form (x^y mod z) for large values of y\n",
    "2. Euclidean Algorithm: calculates the greatist common factor of two numbers\n",
    "3. Extended Euclidean Algorithm: calculates the greatist common factor of two numbers as well as the linear combination for that factor\n",
    "4. Modular Inverse: calculates a number y that makes ((x*y) mod c = 1) true; y can only make the statement true if x and z are relatively prime (i.e., greatest common factor is 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoding and decoding process are elegantly simple once you have the public and private keys. The custom feature shows what information is needed to encode/decode, writes the corresponding output to a file, and provides a user friendly manner to encrypt and decrypt data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What have I learned?\n",
    "I learned about the following topics:\n",
    "* The value of calculations that are easy to do but incredibly difficult to undo\n",
    "* The basic math behind encryption and therefore cybersecurity\n",
    "* Regular expressions\n",
    "* Reading and writing files in python\n",
    "* The power of primes and the importance of a deep knowledge of them for computer scientists\n",
    "* Loops and lists\n",
    "* If/else statements"

On occasion, I would use e instead of d to decode which would result in a briefly confusing error. However, this was easily realized and fixed with examination. I really enjoyed exchanging codes with my classmates. It made me realize how useful and broadly applicable this tool is and why. The potential for mass communication of sensitive information is remarkable and I cannot wait to find out more about the additional tools that were built on top of RSA to make it an even safer method. \n",

    "The Jupyter workbook was so structured that I didn’t really need to plan ahead. I did plan ahead when I did the Euclidean Algorithm, Extended Euclidean Algorithm, and FME on the Mastery Workbook, but that was already complete before this project. For those algorithms, it was helpful for me to start with the calculations I knew would be within the algorithm, write out everything I could, add comments for the things I didn’t, and then work on the commented areas individually. Overall, I think decreasing the size of the problem into digestible parts and creating visuals of the algorithms helped me the most in getting through challenging problems. I think the skill that got me through this project the most was seeing each component in even smaller components and tracking my progress throughout the weeks leading up to the due date. This project was very applicable to the real world, so it was easy for me to stay motivated and come back to it to do a little each day. I think for future projects, I will try to find ways to connect the material to the real world so that I can find the motivation for daily practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What was challenging?\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom code feature and the narratives. The custom code feature was incredibly motivating, but also the most difficult part because it had the least amount of structure. I enjoy making user interfaces, so that felt like the best option for me even though it involved a few things that I didn’t know. I had to spend a good amount of time on regular expressions to understand their power and apply them properly. I had to spend some time understanding how to read and write to files through python, which is something I have always struggled with. I am happy to say that I now feel fully comfortable with it with the added bonus of being able to manipulate the data read from the file. The narrative pieces are hard for me, but not in the way the coding information is. I generally procrastinate anything writing or English related, so I had to specifically give myself small bits of the narratives to write at a time with a lot of breaks because I have so much difficulty focusing on it. I am always proud when I am able to complete a longer writing task. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who helped you with your project?\n",
    "\n",
    "I didn’t receive help from anyone on this project, although I did a lot of research on regular expressions and reading files on various python sites. In addition, I did some background research on RSA for the introduction and to generally understand what I was building for the introductory paragraphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Which resources were most helpful?\n",
    "\n",
    "I found the videos on RSA encryption and the corresponding algorithms to be incredibly helpful. I returned to them many times over the course of the project. In addition, the Number Theory Mastery Workbook and the Cryptography Mastery Workbook were instrumental to the process because I had already done the most difficult parts of the project before even starting. The decode/encode question on the cryptography mastery workbook, although simple, helped me to feel comfortable and knowledgeable with the process when I came to the encode/decode part of the project. I also returned to Khan academy’s videos on cryptography often. They are a very clear and concise reference for the concepts that we have been revisiting over and over for the past few weeks. They do great color-coding in their articles which helped the information to really stick. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What was your Best Mistake, (funniest? most frustrating? the one you learned the most from?)\n",
    "\n",
    "My favorite mistake was messing up any decoding, whether it was from an error in my code or entering the wrong values. A series of unrecognizable characters would pop up just as I was expecting a very English, very understandable string. I had many gasps of exasperation and giggles each time, which honestly just made the whole thing more enjoyable because it was never something I couldn’t work through quickly. "

    "The last 15 points of the require a custom feature in your project. This is an opportinity for you to explore an RSA or coding topic of interest to you. At this point it is not about points, but exploring advanced ideas relevant to you.  This is also a feature that should be relevant to your programming ability. If you are in 1300, creating a main type function may be enough. If you are an experienced programmer, find a topic to push yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The custom feature should be a \"Stand Alone\" feature at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "* If you want to use code from above, please copy the functions again as part of your feature so it can be tested independently.\n",
    "* Be sure to provide a demo of your feature showing that it works. This is a good check for you, shows us it works, and helps us if we are unable to get your feature to work when grading.\n",
    "* Do not forget the self-grading element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom Features could one or more of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Code breaking improvements. An exploration of factoring improvements and analyze how effective they are. Must include some kind of timing analysis and multiple code breaking. A superficial treatment will not recieve full points. Must be throughly tested with excellent investigations to recieve full points.\n",
    "2. A Python \"main\" function that allows a user to \"Get keys/Encode/Decode/Break Codes\" etc... This can use elements of initial RSA code above HOWEVER - Please copy and pan should be organized below. *Please include your complete new implementation below.*\n",
    "3. A script to read codes from Piazza data. You can copy and paste codes from Piazza into a txt files and then have your script read it. This is a VERY helpful tool for doing the project as well. \n",
    "4. Exploration of advanced factoring alogrithms (see Moodle) Try Pollard's Rho <- super satisfying. (full points if well - impemented with thoughtful examples). \n",
    "5. Advanced complexity analysis. \n",
    "6. Frequency anaylsis from our Piazza post.\n",
    "7. A deep dive in the mathematics of the RSA proofs.\n",
    "8. Advance code breaking challenges with  - this should be anorganized and well documented effort.\n",
    "9. More options available, all include a coding element. Please ask is you have an unique idea. \n",

    "NARRATIVE: I learned so much about reading files, manipulating input, and regular expressions. I have always felt uncomfortable with using outside files and I feel fairly fluent now. I have had some theoretical content with regular expressions, but this really solidified the power of using them. My understanding of them now opens up a lot of exciting doors for my future coding skills. I pushed myself with the file data and manipulation. In order to make the data usable from the file, I needed to find a lot of new tools to massage the data into the right format (e.g., map(), regex, join, split(), etc.). In addition, I had a lot of fun thinking about the flow of the user experience with menus and input. The files made the decoding and encoding on Piazza SO MUCH easier and very enjoyable. Overall, I spent way more time on the custom feature than I expected to simply because I loved doing it. Hope you enjoy!"
